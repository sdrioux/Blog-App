==BLOG-APP

Dummy blog created as a student at MakerSquare.  Used to develop my understanding of test driven development.

Uses rspec unit tests for each blog post.  Also uses FactoryGirl and Faker to develop detailed factories for testing, such as the following: 

  FactoryGirl.define do
    factory :post do
      title Faker::Lorem.words(5).map!{|x|x.capitalize}.join(" ")
      body Faker::Lorem.paragraphs(3).join(" ")
      author Faker::Name.name
    end  
  end
